# How to customize content

- In `index.md` reorder or remove section as you prefer.
- In assets `assets/img` are the images used in the various pages
- Footer is in `_data/footer.yml` to update the copyright.
- General config in `_config.yml`.
- You can also add other pages, like `links.md`.
- Edit `_data/menus.yml` to add links in the navigation bar.

# Development
If you want to use this template, or enhance it, you can use Docker.
Just run './build-in-docker.sh' and then point your browser to http://localhost:4000/.

Note: Developing for github pages is tricky. You should always rely on
[safe plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/) because any other, that's not
in the list will simply not run.
